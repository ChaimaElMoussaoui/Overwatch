She shared as much with her daughter in an overdue reunion, before embarking on her own mission with Soldier: 76.

The other criminal organizations in the American Southwest wanted a piece of their pie; the encounters often became violent. After years of skirmishes and bloodshed, Ashe called the heads of the major groups together. Ashe saw the potential to grow the influence of all. She used what she’d learned from her parents’ business to bring order to these groups. Her proposal was that the gangs could work together (or at least, not work against each other). No longer having to focus her energies on squabbles with the other gangs, Ashe wrote her name across the American Southwest with a string of audacious heists and operations that cemented her legacy as an outlaw legend. Her principles? Keep your word, don’t work with the law, respect each other’s territory, and always punish betrayal. Speaking of which, some decades after Cole Cassidy turned coat for Overwatch, the Deadlock Rebels received a tip regarding precious tech moving across their turf via hypertrain. Too lucrative to ignore, the gang planned a train heist, only to learn they were the ones being robbed. Cassidy incapacitated the gang and released Echo into the world, singlehandedly stealing Ashe’s bike, her score, and her shot at revenge. But in these uncertain times, one thing is certain: Ashe gets what she wants. And she and her Deadlock Rebels won't stop until they claim what's theirs (and likely, what's yours).",

But slowly, his unit's orders escalated in brutality, expanding into assassinations and operations with civilian casualties. Confronted by his team's actions, Baptiste realized he was perpetuating a cycle of violence like the one that had destroyed his own community. He abandoned Talon, disgusted with what he had done and determined to forge a new path for himself. But Talon would not let him go. Baptiste knew too much, and they sent operatives to silence him. Agent after agent came for him, including Baptiste's former comrades. To stay under the radar, Baptiste drifted from place to place, aiding in humanitarian efforts around the globe.

Mauga and Trung Le Nguyen, fellow Talon soldiers urged Baptiste to accompany them on a mission to shake down a local businessman, or fight—and die—now. To survive, Baptiste agreed, but when Baptiste found out the man had valuable intel about Overwatch, he saved him. His old friend, Mauga, gave Baptiste one final chance to return to Talon outside of a body bag, but he refused, escaping with the valuable intel: the list of names and locations to which Winston had broadcast Overwatch’s Recall. The hit list of known and likely Overwatch agents spurred Baptiste to warn those unfortunate enough to find their names on it, beginning with Dr. Angela Ziegler. In his efforts to locate Ziegler, Baptiste instead crossed paths with a suspicious Cassidy on his own mission to recruit global heroes for a renewed Overwatch. As Cassidy and Baptiste fell within Talon's crosshairs, their chance encounter and unlikely partnership gave Baptiste a chance at the redemption he sought. Baptiste now works toward a better world, healing where he can and fighting when he must. He knows that he cannot undo his past—but that making a difference now is what matters.",
